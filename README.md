# learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code

Updated by me (Thomas Bridge) in August 2021.

The basic reasoning is that the original repo was set up in 2018, and ansible
has advanced someway in that time.

This was tested on my Macbook running Virtualbox + Vagrant.   Ansible version information is

```bash
(venv) thomas@Thomass-MacBook-Pro lab03 % ansible --version
ansible [core 2.11.4] 
  config file = None
  configured module search path = ['/Users/thomas/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /Users/thomas/Projects/learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ansible
  ansible collection location = /Users/thomas/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections
  executable location = /Users/thomas/Projects/learning_lab_vagrant_netprog_code/venv/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.8.2 (default, Jun  8 2021, 11:59:35) [Clang 12.0.5 (clang-1205.0.22.11)]
  jinja version = 3.0.1
  libyaml = True
```
